##GAME RULES:
 
A simple memory game using Processing. 

1. all of the cards are laid face down on a surface. 

2. The user choose one of the card to flip the face up.

3. The card that user chooses previously would stay face up until user choose another card.

4. If those two cards have the same picture (which means they are matching cards), they will all stay face up, otherwise they will be all laid face down again.

5. If all the cards are face up, then the user win the game.
